To be able to read the Samba manual pages using the man command, the directory where Samba's manual pages reside, /usr/local/samba/man by default, must be in your MANPATH environment variable. On Red Hat Linux, this can be accomplished by adding the following two lines to /etc/man.config:

 MANPATH            /usr/local/samba/man
MANPATH_MAP        /usr/local/samba/bin     /usr/local/samba/man

question: using xargs to cd to a directory
The pipe runs xargs in a subprocess, and xargs runs cd in a subprocess. Changes in a subprocess do not get propagated to the parent process.

The command cd is a built-in because the information about the current directory is tied to a process and only shell built-in can change current directory of the running shell.


There are two problems with your code:
a. xargs cannot run cd because cd is a built-in command and xargs can run only executable files.
b. Even if you run cd in a sub-process called from xargs, it will not have any effect on the parent process as explained above.
The solution is to run a sub-shell, inside it run cd and then you can execute commands in the new current directory.

ls | xargs -L 1 bash -c 'cd "$0" && pwd && ls'
