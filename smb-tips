This brings out an important point in Samba terminology:

A server is a computer with a resource to share.

A client is a computer that wishes to use that resource.

A computer can be a client, a server, or both, or it can be neither at any given time.


The client and server must complete three steps to establish a connection to a resource:

Establish a NetBIOS session.

Negotiate the protocol variant.

Set session parameters, and make a tree connection to a resource.
